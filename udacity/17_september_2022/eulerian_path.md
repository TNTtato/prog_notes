# Eulerian Path

In a graph, an `eulerian path` it's a path that starts in a node and ends in another going throgh the links or edges of the graphs but only once.

The degree of a node is the number of conections with other nodes. If a node have an even degree, then it would nerver could be the ending node, beacuse the inputs are equal to de outputs.

So the ending in a graph must be a node that has a odd degree.

By all means, if a graph contains two nodes with odd degree, then it has a eulerian path, if not, it does not. The exception is when all nodes have a even degree
