# Bus Messages Bot

This project can be done in two ways.

The first is to connect with an API and from there obtain all the data necessary for the project. When a bus the user chose is close to a particular station, also chosen by the user, a notification alert is sent.

The other option is to make the own mantainers thar keep track of all the needed data.

The user must be able to configure the whole week, in such a way that each day a bus, a station and a route can be modified.

The app could also tell you how long it's going to take from the starting point to the destination, at least an estimate.

A skip bus option should be added, this way the app should indicate when the next one will arrive
