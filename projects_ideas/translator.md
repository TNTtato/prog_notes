# Translator

The main idea is to implement a simple translator.

This translator would only take the literal meaning of a word in a language as a starting point and translate it into the target language.

For this it would be a good idea to implement libraries such as binary search trees in the alphabetical order of words in a language.

For this, a database is needed to store the dictionaries.

Supported languages would be those that are written with the Latin alphabet and all its derivations (i.e. accents and such)
