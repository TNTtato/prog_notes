# Answering Bot

This project consists of a bot that answers messages from a list of contacts in a predefined way.

For this project, a library of predefined messages must be created, so that the same message can be sent to different people, and different people can have more than one message

These messages should be grouped into categories just like the contact list, so that the best message can be found based on the category of the message and the category of the person.

A specific hour must be defined when these messages can be sent, so an interface is needed to make these settings.

A history log should also be implemented to keep track of all messages, categories, contacts, and the time a message was sent.
